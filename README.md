#Currency Convertion App by Mehmet Ali Se√ßgin

Usage: after downloading the code, simply run the "CurrencyApplication.java" file.
I'm using Java Spring Boot and ThymeLeaf for visualizing.

[localhost:8080/](localhost:8080) directs you to the form.

Input the currencies you want to convert from-to and the amount.
The site will redirect you to another page called [localhost:8080/exchange](localhost:8080)

If you want to change the intermediary currencies, you can add currencies as parameters: "?inter=RUB,TRY,JPY"

By default, program Converts 100 USD to EUR using the intermediary currencies: "SGD", "MYR", "RUB", "SEK", "AUD", "JPY", "TRY", "HKD", "CAD", "INR"

Program might be slow because of the free Currency Converter API I'm using.

Here's the link for the api [Rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange/)
My API key is in the code.
